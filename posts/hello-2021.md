With a new year upon us, we also have a new blog! In this first post, we would like to take a look back at some of the highlights from 2020, as well as some ideas we have for 2021.

## Looking Back at 2020

This year has been a challenging one, to say the least. Nonetheless, the team has made the best of a difficult situation. In addition to iterating on the current ecosystem, there are some incredible things that we accomplished as a team. METRICS?

- Vue.js 3
- Vite, a new web dev tool
- Vue Router 4
- Vuex 4 - RC
- Vue DevTools 6 - Beta
- New docs site for Vue 3
- New Single File Component RFCs (`<script setup>`, CSS var injection)
- VueDX Extension
- Vue Test Utils 2 - Beta
- VitePress, a new docs generator built on Vite

In addition to all of these amazing projects, it’s also been incredible to see the community continue to grow despite the challenges 2020 set forth in terms of being unable to facilitate in-person events. With initiatives such as remote conferences, meetups and other events, it’s been a joy to see the community interacting in new ways that might not have been possible otherwise.

## Looking Forward to 2021

With a new year upon us, here are some of the things we’re looking forward to:

- Vue.js 3 Migration Tool (Q1)
- Vue.js 3 IE 11 Compatibility Build (Q2)
- Vue.js 3.1
- Vue CLI 5
- Vuex 5
- And much more

In addition, we are excited about other frameworks and libraries in the ecosystem making progress towards Vue 3 support. And of course, we can’t wait to see what new ideas and tools you all have as we embark on a new era in the Vue.js roadmap.
